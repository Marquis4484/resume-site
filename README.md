# MS Portfolio Site

Hello! Thank you for checking out my project. This is a small react project that showcases how I can make an a modern website the contains popular features such as a
dark mode and a small navigation bar. 

You can view my project here : 

## Components

Inside this folder is where most of the work is stored. I usually try to keep all of my work in one folder. As a result, the app component only renders a single component called
Content.

### Content
Content is where each component is placed on renderd.


### Nav

The nav bar contains links to both sections of this project, a hamburger menu, and a dark mode toggle switch.


### Intro

This compnent is the first page that you will see. It contains a small introduction about myself and contians a link to both my resume and my github.
